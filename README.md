# Projects_Studies
in this section I archived which I've completed during my studies

1. R_Eurostat_EU_Map_Visualization
 - An application in R which downloads the latest data from Eurostat and visualises it for selected filters in a table and on a map of Europe.
   Link to data is available in the code. However, the code downloads the data automatically after running it.

2. Credit_Scoring_Python_SAS_Classification
 - Project covering the construction of a risk model measuring the probability of the event that a customer repays a loan for an instalment loan.
   The outcome of the project is a predictive model. Its results are generated in excel files.
   These files contain information about the features and their relevance, as well as a final report on the operation of the model.
   Data is available in project folder (.zip file).
